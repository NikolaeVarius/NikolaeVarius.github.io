            <p>Hi. My name is <strong>Joseph Kim.</strong></p>
            <p>I'm formally trained as an Aeronautical Engineer, but really, I just like learning about everything. This website was created by me in order to learn front end web development and to serve as a base so that I could try out different things in the world of programming. I also try to post things from time to time with random thoughts. </p>

                I currently work as a Control Systems Engineer for UTC Pratt and Whitney. I manage the data that is used to create software that keeps aircraft engines running properly. You would be surprised as to what some of this software says, but of course, its all UTC proprietary so I can't say much online. But "Plane Engine on Fire" error are pretty funny.

            First thing would be this website. I've already learned a ton from making this, but I can't believe I actually finally managed to fully deploy a personal website. Hopefully I'll be adding more content as time goes on. You can read more about my thoughts on the "News" page.
