	 	<div class="panel-body">I've never been formally trained on design. Truthfully as an engineer, I've always eschewed design in favor of functionality. However, I am a sucker for consistancy of design.



	 	But even then, saying that, this website is a bit of a sandbox for me, which is why there are sometimes vastly different designs on pages. It's all in good fun.

	 		My end game goal here is to eventally move onto Ruby on Rails. While a static site is awesome at its simplicity, it would be nice to have the flexibility of a database driven dynamic website. Luckily, Jekyll should integrate fairly easily into a RoR website. I just need some time to learn.

I prefer the term "Working Copy". But mostly its because I'm still screwing around with the HTML/CSS/JS spec and so there are tons of horrible hacks and stuff I've written that I was using to test out different aspects of the website. Hopefully, by the time anyone other than me reads this, I will have refactored my code properly.
