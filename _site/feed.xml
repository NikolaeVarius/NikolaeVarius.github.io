        <title>What's One More Year, One Trip Around The Sun?</title>
        <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As the first actual post on this site, I've realized how much work I've put into this from the ground up. I can really say I'm grateful for the internet as its allowed me access information to insane amounts of information so fast.

I'm not much of a designer. I used to have aspirations of drawing for a bit during high school. It was an embarassing failure. I was trained to be an aeronautical engineer. The most drawing we ever did was in CAD and possibly some random scribbles in a notebook about airfoils.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post that I will post on this website. Stay Tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
