        <title>On Trials and Tribulations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I read something once somewhere that has really affected my outlook on life. This is of course heavily paraphrased but it went something like this. A man needs have three outlets in life. A creative outlet, a physical outlet, and a mental outlet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had the first two down. I’m a pretty avid tabletop games player. I have an entire Warhammer 40k Army, which sadly enough, might be worth more than most everything else I own. I can’t believe I’ve speant over 6 years assembling and painting that stuff. And that I still suck at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for physical, I lift heavy things and put them down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site right here is supposed to be my mental outlet. There is a lot to learn in the world of programming. Web Development is just a first step torwards other programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's One More Year, One Trip Around The Sun?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first actual post on this site, I’ve realized how much work I’ve put into this from the ground up. I can really say I’m grateful for the internet as its allowed me access information to insane amounts of information so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a designer. I used to have aspirations of drawing for a bit during high school. It was an embarassing failure. I was trained to be an aeronautical engineer. The most drawing we ever did was in CAD and possibly some random scribbles in a notebook about airfoils.&lt;/p&gt;
