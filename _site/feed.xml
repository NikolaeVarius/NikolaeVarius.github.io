        <title>Thoughts on Unreal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty insane how much cool new stuff is CONSTANTLY coming out. It sucks when I’m on the sidelines trying to learn the basis, and here comes along SOMETHING AMAZINGLY AWESOME that I shouldn’t use just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unreal Engine 4 was released for free today and good god it’s beautiful. I’ve tried it out, and its pretty amazing how powerful it is. The lighting stuff is cool as well as the blueprints for different games, though I doubt the usability of those blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have some ideas about creating a mobile game, but I have no idea if its overkill or not. I will have to continue experimenting. But man, I’m really raring to go after some Android development now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Developing a Site Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that whoever is reading this page probably had the reaction so distinctly laid out by this post title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I’m not much of a designer or artist. I pay some lip service to good design, but otherwise I’m firmly entrenched in the world of practical design. Beauty, in my eyes, tends to be a side effect of efficient design, a Jet is beautiful because the airframe is designed to be sleek as a direct result of drag reduction requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, this website is a platform for me to learn. I like testing out some design langugages, namely Google’s Material Design, because I like the idea of a unified design schema that provides assets to quickly roll out apps that look consistant. In the About Page, I put some thoughts on it. I like the idea of Material Design, but I really think if Google wants to get serious with a design language, they need to follow their own guidelines. I don’t necessarily follow them all, but I also don’t agree with a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Trials and Tribulations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I read something once somewhere that has really affected my outlook on life. This is of course heavily paraphrased but it went something like this. A man needs have three outlets in life. A creative outlet, a physical outlet, and a mental outlet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had the first two down. I’m a pretty avid tabletop games player. I have an entire Warhammer 40k Army, which sadly enough, might be worth more than most everything else I own. I can’t believe I’ve speant over 6 years assembling and painting that stuff. And that I still suck at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for physical, I lift heavy things and put them down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site right here is supposed to be my mental outlet. There is a lot to learn in the world of programming. Web Development is just a first step torwards other programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning this stuff is pretty fun, though somewhat frustrating. I quite literally have 5 browsers working simultaneously. Firefox Dev Edition because that’s my main browser and its developer console is really nice, Chrome, because that mobile emulator tool is pretty cool though its usefulness is suspect to me because it doesn’t seem to function the same as the actual mobile browesr, Chrome on Android, because it’s the current stock Android browser and its based on webview, the AOSP Browser, because that’s still based on webkit, and Vivaldi, just because it’s new and kinda neat, even though its based on Chromium, so it should render the same as Chrome anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desktop browsers all seem to render just fine across the board. Though I really need to test this on IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on mobile it’s a different story. Animations render wildly differently on webview and webkit. It seems that webview has a much easier time rendering animations as it at least attempts to do them on the fly, while I think webkit waits until the browser has stopped updating the view and then updates the zoom levels of certain elements of the nav bar, which leads to extremely jerky behavior. I don’t have an iOS device, so I can’t test it on Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's One More Year, One Trip Around The Sun?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first actual post on this site, I’ve realized how much work I’ve put into this from the ground up. I can really say I’m grateful for the internet as its allowed me access information to insane amounts of information so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a designer. I used to have aspirations of drawing for a bit during high school. It was an embarassing failure. I was trained to be an aeronautical engineer. The most drawing we ever did was in CAD and possibly some random scribbles in a notebook about airfoils.&lt;/p&gt;
