It's pretty insane how much cool new stuff is CONSTANTLY coming out. It sucks when I'm on the sidelines trying to learn the basis, and here comes along SOMETHING AMAZINGLY AWESOME that I shouldn't use just yet.

The Unreal Engine 4 was released for free today and good god it's beautiful. I've tried it out, and its pretty amazing how powerful it is. The lighting stuff is cool as well as the blueprints for different games, though I doubt the usability of those blueprints.

I did have some ideas about creating a mobile game, but I have no idea if its overkill or not. Will have to continue experimenting.
