I read something once somewhere that has really affected my outlook on life. This is of course heavily paraphrased but it went something like this. A man needs have three outlets in life. A creative outlet, a physical outlet, and a mental outlet. 

I already had the first two down. I'm a pretty avid tabletop games player. I have an entire Warhammer 40k Army, which sadly enough, might be worth more than most everything else I own. I can't believe I've speant over 6 years assembling and painting that stuff. And that I still suck at it.

As for physical, I lift heavy things and put them down. 

This site right here is supposed to be my mental outlet. There is a lot to learn in the world of programming. Web Development is just a first step torwards other programming.

Learning this stuff is pretty fun, though somewhat frustrating. I quite literally have 5 browsers working simultaneously. Firefox Dev Edition because that's my main browser and its developer console is really nice, Chrome, because that mobile emulator tool is pretty cool though its usefulness is suspect to me because it doesn't seem to function the same as the actual mobile browesr, Chrome on Android, because it's the current stock Android browser and its based on webview, the AOSP Browser, because that's still based on webkit, and Vivaldi, just because it's new and kinda neat, even though its based on Chromium, so it should render the same as Chrome anyway. 

The desktop browsers all seem to render just fine across the board. Though I really need to test this on IE.

However, on mobile it's a different story. Animations render wildly differently on webview and webkit. It seems that webview has a much easier time rendering animations as it at least attempts to do them on the fly, while I think webkit waits until the browser has stopped updating the view and then updates the zoom levels of certain elements of the nav bar, which leads to extremely jerky behavior. I don't have an iOS device, so I can't test it on Safari.
