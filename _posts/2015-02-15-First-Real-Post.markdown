	As the first actual post on this site, I've realized how much work I've put into this from the ground up. I can really say I'm grateful for the internet as its allowed me access information to insane amounts of information so fast.

	I'm not much of a designer. I used to have aspirations of drawing for a bit during high school. It was an embarassing failure. I was trained to be an aeronautical engineer. The most drawing we ever did was in CAD and possibly some random scribbles in a notebook about airfoils.
