I read something once somewhere that has really affected my outlook on life. This is of course heavily paraphrased but it went something like this. A man needs have three outlets in life. A creative outlet, a physical outlet, and a mental outlet. 

I already had the first two down. I'm a pretty avid tabletop games player. I have an entire Warhammer 40k Army, which sadly enough, might be worth more than most everything else I own. I can't believe I've speant over 6 years assembling and painting that stuff. And that I still suck at it.

As for physical, I lift heavy things and put them down. 

This site right here is supposed to be my mental outlet. There is a lot to learn in the world of programming. Web Development is just a first step torwards other programming.
