I know that whoever is reading this page probably had the reaction so distinctly laid out by this post title.

Sadly, I'm not much of a designer or artist. I pay some lip service to good design, but otherwise I'm firmly entrenched in the world of practical design. Beauty, in my eyes, tends to be a side effect of efficient design, a Jet is beautiful because the airframe is designed to be sleek as a direct result of drag reduction requirements.

But, this website is a platform for me to learn. I like testing out some design langugages, namely Google's Material Design, because I like the idea of a unified design schema that provides assets to quickly roll out apps that look consistant. In the About Page, I put some thoughts on it. I like the idea of Material Design, but I really think if Google wants to get serious with a design language, they need to follow their own guidelines. I don't necessarily follow them all, but I also don't agree with a few of them.
